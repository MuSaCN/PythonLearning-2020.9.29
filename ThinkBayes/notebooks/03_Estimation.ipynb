    "Among Bayesians, there are two approaches to choosing prior\n",

    "background information about the problem; in that case the prior is said\n",
    "to be **informative**. The problem with using an\n",
    "informative prior is that people might use different background\n",
    "information (or interpret it differently). So informative priors often\n",
    "seem subjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative is a so-called **uninformative prior**,\n",
    "which is intended to be as unrestricted as possible, in order to let the\n",
    "data speak for themselves. In some cases you can identify a unique prior\n",
    "that has some desirable property, like representing minimal prior\n",
    "information about the estimated quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uninformative priors are appealing because they seem more objective. But\n",
    "I am generally in favor of using informative priors. Why? First,\n",
    "Bayesian analysis is always based on modeling decisions. Choosing the\n",
    "prior is one of those decisions, but it is not the only one, and it\n",
    "might not even be the most subjective. So even if an uninformative prior\n",
    "is more objective, the entire analysis is still subjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for most practical problems, you are likely to be in one of two\n",
    "regimes: either you have a lot of data or not very much. If you have a\n",
    "lot of data, the choice of the prior doesn’t matter very much;\n",
    "informative and uninformative priors yield almost the same results.\n",
    "We’ll see an example like this in the next chapter.\n",
    "\n",
