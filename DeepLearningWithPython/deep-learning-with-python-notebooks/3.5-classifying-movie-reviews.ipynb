    "* There's usually quite a bit of preprocessing you need to do on your raw data in order to be able to feed it -- as tensors -- into a neural \n",
    "network. In the case of sequences of words, they can be encoded as binary vectors -- but there are other encoding options too.\n",
    "* Stacks of `Dense` layers with `relu` activations can solve a wide range of problems (including sentiment classification), and you will \n",
    "likely use them frequently.\n",
    "* In a binary classification problem (two output classes), your network should end with a `Dense` layer with 1 unit and a `sigmoid` activation, \n",
    "i.e. the output of your network should be a scalar between 0 and 1, encoding a probability.\n",
    "* With such a scalar sigmoid output, on a binary classification problem, the loss function you should use is `binary_crossentropy`.\n",
    "* The `rmsprop` optimizer is generally a good enough choice of optimizer, whatever your problem. That's one less thing for you to worry \n",
    "about.\n",
    "* As they get better on their training data, neural networks eventually start _overfitting_ and end up obtaining increasingly worse results on data \n",
    "never-seen-before. Make sure to always monitor performance on data that is outside of the training set.\n"
